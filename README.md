# game_screenshots

Here are some screenshots for the game UI database, I'm not exactly sure on the usage rights, I think this should be fine and covered by fair use where that exists. If asked to do it I will take them down.

The content and material depicted are owned by the respective companies and not by me, so I don't think I own them or the screenshots and it's the usual grey area.

I am taking them purely for the purpose of documentation and archiving, which I think is a good intention and that should factor in somehow.
